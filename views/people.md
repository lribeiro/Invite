Is currently an assistant professor at the Computer Science
Department of Instituto Superior Técnico – Technical University of
Lisbon (IST-UTL), where he teaches courses on User Centred Design,
Social Intelligent Agents and Game Design and Development. 
Is a senior researcher at INESC-ID, member of GAIPS, Intelligent Agents and Synthetic Character Group.

His research interests are on social intelligence of virtual agents and its
application to games. The current research focus is on social power and
social identification as means to achieve believability in complex
social situations and on the use of online platforms, such as Facebook
and OpenSimulator, for serious gaming.  

He is currently the
vice-president of the SPCVideojogos (Sociedade Portuguesa de Ciências
dos Videojogos).

At Instituto Superior Técnico, Carlos Martinho has been helping
educating Engineers, Masters and Doctors since 1996. His teachings cover
subjects such as computer graphics, human-computer interaction, game
design and technology, and artificial life.
 
At GAIPS, since its foundation, he works at the frontier between
computer graphics and artificial intelligence, building agent-based
synthetic characters, using approaches from several subfield of
artificial intelligence such as anticipatory computing, affective
computing and artificial life.

Dr. Pena examines the cognitive, emotional and behavioral foundations of
computer-mediated interaction. He is interested in how people
communicate and develop impressions when interacting through
recreational and instrumental technologies (video games, email, instant
messenger, etc.). 

His most recent work looks at how priming users with
social stereotypes through uniforms and roles facilitates non-conscious
responses in virtual contexts. Dr. Pena employs experiments and content
analysis as primary research tools.

## Luís Landeiro Ribeiro (PDM&FC)

Has built and now co-founded a Massive Multiplayer Online Browser Game called Almansur <http://www.almansur.net> with some friends.
Since that inception has largely left the enterprise world behind and drunk the startup spirit kool-aid, 
started a large evangelization on his day job company @ <http://www.pdmfc.com> to get everybody up to speed with the lastest piece of tech. 
Since 2005 has been pushing for Ruby On Rails, Git, Coffescript, JQuery (the list seams to go on forever) and lean development techniques as a replacement for the old arts our company used to built upon.

As a technical evangelist his day job gets him to explore all kinds of
cool stuff, from building and SMS gateway in mirah
<http://www.mirah.org> for android, testing jruby head and Openjdk 1.7
invokedynamic patches to extract every once of performance from our game
engine, integrating RoR apps into a Liferay corporate portal and
seamlessly integrate them through SSO.

More recently, has been focused on improving web applications to
leverage on the HTML5 goodies, exploring canvas, offline storage,
javascript frameworks (underscore.js, backbone.js, sproutcore) along the
way, this normally includes sleepless nights debugging some weird edge
case on some weird browser (read IE9) and trying to get performance up
to a reasonable level. 

Though ruby continues to be a great love affair,
finds himself slipping into scala or golang more often when in need of good
performance or for highly concurrent apps.
